# VSCode AI-Driven Code Assistant Extension

This VSCode extension is designed to assist developers by leveraging Generative AI to enhance productivity through various tasks like code analysis, generating unit tests, explaining code, and integrating with JIRA. It is built for the Databricks Generative AI Hackathon.

## Features

### 1. **Scan Code for Defects**
   - **Command**: `hackathon.scanCodeForDefects`
   - Analyzes the active file for any defects using diagnostic messages and AI-generated suggestions.
   - Provides improvement suggestions based on the analysis.

### 2. **Create JIRA Ticket**
   - **Command**: `hackathon.createJiraTicket`
   - Automatically generates JIRA tickets for detected code defects.
   - When used through the chat interface, it automatically fills out all fields like title, description, assignee, and reporter based on the provided code context.
   - Uses AI to generate a concise description of the issue and a proposed fix.

### 3. **Run Test Coverage Analysis**
   - **Command**: `hackathon.runTestCoverageAnalysis`
   - Analyzes the test coverage of the active file using LCOV reports.
   - Highlights areas in the code with low test coverage and suggests tests to improve it.

### 4. **View Outstanding JIRA Tickets**
   - **Command**: `hackathon.viewOutstandingTickets`
   - Allows users to view assigned JIRA issues.
   - Provides a list of issues for selected usgers, with options to view details directly in the JIRA platform.

### 5. **Explain Code**
   - **Command**: `hackathon.codeExplanation`
   - Generates an easy-to-understand explanation for the selected code snippet.
   - Useful for onboarding new developers or understanding complex sections of the codebase.

### 6. **Generate Unit Tests**
   - **Command**: `hackathon.generateUnitTests`
   - Automatically generates unit tests for the selected code snippet.
   - Provides AI-generated test cases based on the input code logic.

### 7. **Interactive Chat with AI**
   - The extension includes a chat-based interface where users can interact with the AI for a wide range of features.
   - Chat commands include scanning code for defects, creating JIRA tickets, generating unit tests, and more.
   - When creating a JIRA ticket through the chat, the AI automatically fills out the fields like title, description, and more, based on the context of the selected code.
   - The chat interface provides a more conversational approach to access all commands, making it easy to get help or perform actions without manually navigating through menus.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Visual Studio Code**: Version 1.80.0 or later.
- **Node.js**: Version 16.x or later.
- **JIRA API Access**: Requires JIRA email and API token for integration.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nick-starr-kr/KR-DMP-Hackathon.git

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

3. Open the project in VSCode and press F5 to run the extension in a new Extension Development Host.


### Environment Variables

- `ATLASSIAN_EMAIL`: The email address associated with your JIRA account, used for authenticating API requests.
- `ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN`: A token generated from your JIRA account for secure API access, allowing the extension to create and manage JIRA issues.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: The API key used to authenticate with OpenAI's services, enabling the extension to access AI-powered features like code analysis and unit test generation.
- `JIRA_API_KEY`: A token for secure access to JIRAâ€™s API, allowing the extension to interact with JIRA functionalities like fetching user data and creating tickets.


### Usage

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` in VSCode and search for the following commands to access various features:
  - `Scan Code for Defects`
  - `Create JIRA Ticket`
  - `Run Test Coverage Analysis`
  - `View Outstanding JIRA Tickets`
  - `Explain Code`
  - `Generate Unit Tests`
- Alternatively, use the chat interface for a more conversational approach to access these commands and get real-time responses from the AI.

## Project Structure
